I am a Propel Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University's School of Medicine (in the Department of Epidemiology & Population Health).
I earned my PhD in sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles. My research interests include immigration, inequality, and race/ethnicity. I love talking about bachata, salsa (all types), and social demography.
